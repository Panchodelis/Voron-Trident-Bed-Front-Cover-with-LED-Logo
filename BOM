### ðŸ’¡ Notes
- The LED channels are designed for **5 mm wide strips**, which **slide into dedicated guide rails** â€” no adhesive required.  
- The design allows for easy removal or replacement of LED strips for maintenance.  
- LED strips are **24 V SMD 2835 red**, compatible with fan ports on the **Leviathan MCU**.  
- If your board provides **5 V** instead of 24 V, use a **5 V LED strip** of the same 5 mm width.  
- Power is routed through a **pair of DC jack connectors (male + female)** for quick disconnection.  
- Ensure the LED circuit is **fused** or connected through a **switched 24 V rail**.  
- The **rear cover is optional** â€” light bleed through the convection vents will depend on LED brightness.  
  For reference, the LEDs in the reference build run at **~10 % intensity** from a **24 V fan port**, resulting in minimal light leakage and balanced illumination.
